- Defeat the bats in the cave.
- When a certain number of them are defeated, the round is cleared.
- The ending is after 5 rounds of clearing.
- Shones move left and right, and jumps when pressed upward.
- The sight can be moved with the cursor keys while holding down the space key.
- Release the space key to throw the knife.
- If you knock down a bat, you get a score based on the distance the knife flew. If you miss, you get -10pts.
- If the shorts hit a bat or other object, or if the score is zero, it is a miss.
- If you make a mistake when there is zero remaining, the game is over.
